            <h1><b>Introduction</b></h1>
            <p> The data set that is about to be shown is a sample. 
                It is a small portion of the whole data set that was researched. 
                Among all the respondents, we only took 50 of their responses. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In this data, the target population are those that are like us, students, 
                who are currently aiming for high marks while being sleep-deprived. 
                From what it seems like, the researchers used simple random sampling when gathering the data.
            </p>
            <p>
                To further elaborate this data, we must identify the qualitative and quantitative data. 
                The number of hours the respondents spent on studying is to be considered as the qualitative data. 
                The average scores of the students is an example of quantitative data. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This report seeks to elucidate the significance of understanding our peers' study routines and 
                how such knowledge can profoundly shape our own aspirations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Knowing how long our peers study for is crucial knowledge that goes beyond simple curiosities and is essential 
                to improving our educational experiences. By exposing the subtle aspects of this dynamic, 
                we have a better chance to create a community where we can help one another and share knowledge, 
               thus maximizing the creativity and brainpower of our school community.
            </p>
            <p>
                Through this report, we aim to shed light on how student study hours affect the academic achievement, the learning process, 
                and the general student well-being. We examine the effects on teaching methods, peer pressure, and cooperative 
                learning techniques. We aim to educate students and teachers alike on how this knowledge may be utilized to change the face of modern 
                education through empirical data as well as perceptive analysis.
