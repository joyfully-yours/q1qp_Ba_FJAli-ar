                <p>
                    When observing the data graphs above, we notice that there is a significantly lower 
                    amount of students who take their time to study for more than 4 hours. Only about 12% 
                    of students study one fourth of their day. The graph is positively skewed with an outlier. 
                    This outlier tells us that out of 50 students, there are 12 students who study for 3-4 hours. 

                    Based on the charts above, we can also infer from the data chart below that an average score 
                    of a student is significantly higher after studying for 5-6 hours on average compared to 
                    those who study for a shorter period of time. These show direct results that a student dedicating 
                    more of their time in learning submit better outputs and scores. We learn from picking apart 
                    the habits of students, being able to practice study habits is an essential part of education
                    and academics.

                    The more students take time to learn, read, and write what they see, the more they are able to 
                    remember and feel familiar with the lessons given to them. It is important for students to take 
                    their time accordingly in their studies in order to achieve marks that give them opportunities in 
                    more fields. While the hours a student spends on studying does not heavily correlate to the marks 
                    they receive, it is still important to note that it has an undeniable effect on ones grades.

                    Students are susceptible to cramming, especially when a topic is viewed as difficult, and are more 
                    likely to distance themselves from academic tasks. Instead of studying for hours on end in a short 
                    stretch and limiting them to one day, dividing the time to study is an effective method of studying. 
                    This can improve memory in the long run, as well as avoiding burnout when encountering new and 
                    time-consuming topics. This allows for a better schedule with time constraints, as well as 
                    extracurricular activities they may have. 

                    The process of forgetting what was initially studied and retrieving more information on the topic 
                    jogs the memory and exercises the brain. This helps ground the concepts of the initial lesson in 
                    place, while also retrieving and learning new information about the topic. This may be what makes 
                    it so effective.
